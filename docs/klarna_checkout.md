# KLARNA CHECKOUT PROCESS

> KLARNA CHECKOUT lets you:
 - Offer a checkout experience where Klarna collects your consumer's billing and shipping address details, handles popular payment methods, and fraud management on your behalf in one integration
 - Integrate this using JSON REST API and JavaScript, or other SDKs
 - Apply your visual guidelines to get a branded experience

 ---

?> Klarna Checkout consists of 2 parts:

 ## Checkout Page Snippet - Create the order 🛒
### Render the checkout page 👩‍💻
- Call Klarna's server with your customer ```cart details```, ```locale```, ```merchant ID``` and a few more details.
- Response is a HTML snippet - this needs to be embedded in your checkout page.

--- 

### Render the confirmation page 💫
After the customer completed the purchase in checkout snippet:
- Call Klarna to get confirmation page HTML snippet
- If request is successful, Klarna returns HTML snippet with order confirmation details you need to embed in confirmation page.

> ***__Needed from the merchant:__***
- **Checkout** and **Confirmation** page each containing div that will contain HTML snippets received from Klarna
- **Push URL**, where Klarna informs merchant of order status. **_Push URL_** should contain ```order_id``` placeholder that Klarna will fill in
- **Terms and Conditions URL**. Klarna will provide customer with link to your terms and conditions in certain phases of the order
- Review security of merchant site

 #### 3. Render the Snippet in Your Checkout Page 👨‍💻
 Get the value of ```html_snippet``` from create checkout order call response and embed into merchant checkout page (either embed in page served by backend endpoint, or through Ajax call from server and dynamically inject using JavaScript)
 ```javascript
 getSnippet(function (htmlSnippet) {
   var checkoutContainer = document.getElementById('my-checkout-container')
   checkoutContainer.innerHTML = htmlSnippet
   var scriptsTags = checkoutContainer.getElementsByTagName('script')
   // This is necessary otherwise the scripts tags are not going to be evaluated
   for (var i = 0; i < scriptsTags.length; i++) {
       var parentNode = scriptsTags[i].parentNode
       var newScriptTag = document.createElement('script')
       newScriptTag.type = 'text/javascript'
       newScriptTag.text = scriptsTags[i].text
       parentNode.removeChild(scriptsTags[i])
       parentNode.appendChild(newScriptTag)
   }
})

 ```

 This is what it should look like:

### Handling an Existing Order 💁‍

!> Keep track of Klarna ```order_id``` associated with current customer to avoid creating new order every time customer loads the checkout page. This will allow customer to reload checkout page without having to re-enter any details they have provided.<br><br>
When customer loads checkout page and they have a Klarna ```order_id``` associated with their session, you should fetch the order from Klarna. If the order contents have changed, you should update the order.


#### 1. Retrieve the Order ◀️
Use the checkout order_id to fetch the order from Klarna

##### Retrieve Checkout Order Request 🎣
```JSON
GET /checkout/v3/orders/order_id
Authorization: Basic pwhcueUff0MmwLShJiBE9JHA==
Content-Type: application/json
```

##### Retrieve Checkout Order Response 🎣
```JSON
{
 "order_id": "1203c28c-f101-765f-bed8-f57a2d5e83e0",
 "status": "checkout_incomplete",
 "purchase_country": "se",
 "purchase_currency": "sek",
 "locale": "en-GB",
 "billing_address": {.............
 ..............
```

##### Update the Checkout Order ➕
You should update the checkout order to reflect the changes the customer made to the cart by doing another ```POST``` request.
```JSON
POST /checkout/v3/orders/order_id
Authorization: Basic pwhcueUff0MmwLShJiBE9JHA==
Content-Type: application/json
{
 "order_amount": 756682,
 "order_tax_amount": 151336,
 "order_lines": [
   {
     "type": "physical",
     "reference": "19-402-SWE",
     "name": "Camera Travel Set",
     "quantity": 1,
     "quantity_unit": "pcs",
     "unit_price": 603341,
     "tax_rate": 2500,
     "total_amount": 503341,
     "total_discount_amount": 100000,
     "total_tax_amount": 100668,
     "image_url": "http://merchant.com/logo.png"
   },
   {...........
   ..............
```
You will then get an updated Order Response. :raised_hands:

## Show Purchase Confirmation - Purchase complete :100:
?> Retrieving the checkout order and rendering the confirmation HTML snippet on your confirmation page <br>
Once customer completed purchase, they will be redirected to confirmation page specified in ```merchant_urls.confirmation``` property when you created the order.

E.g. with the following merchant urls:
```JSON
"merchant_urls": {
   "terms": "http://merchant.com/tac.php",
   "checkout": "http://merchant.com/checkout.php?sid={checkout.order.id}",
   "confirmation": "http://merchant.com/thankyou.php?sid={checkout.order.id}",
   "push": "http://merchant.com/kco/push.php?checkout_uri={checkout.order.id}"
 }
```
The user would be redirected to merchant_urls.confirmation: ```http://merchant.com/thankyou.php?sid={checkout.order.id}```

#### 1. Retrieve the Checkout Order 🎣
Use the checkout order_id found in the query parameter ```sid``` in ```merchant_urls.confirmation``` to fetch order from Klarna.
```JSON
GET /checkout/v3/orders/order_id
Authorization: Basic pwhcueUff0MmwLShJiBE9JHA==
Content-Type: application/json
```
---

#### 2. Create an Order in Your System ✍️
Create the order in your system with order data that you want to store. See the full resource structure in [Order Management API](https://developers.klarna.com/api/#order-management-api)

---

#### 3. Render the Confirmation Snippet 💫
Checkout order now contains updated HTML snippet under ```html_snippet``` property. Display this snippet on your confirmation page.

<h4 align="center">Confirmation snippet</h4>
<p align="center">

## Confirm the Purchase 👍
Confirm that you have received and created an order in your system. This is needed in response to a push notification from Klarna, indicating that customer has completed a purchase.

?> Use Case: Customer has completed purchase with Klarna Checkout and merchant wants to create associated order in system

#### 1. Handle the Klarna POST Request 📲
Once customer has completed purchase, Klarna notifies you by sending a POST request to the __push notification URL__ in ```merchant_urls``` object.

Example, with the following ```merchant_urls``` object
```JSON
"merchant_urls": {
   "terms": "http://merchant.com/tac.php",
   "checkout": "http://merchant.com/checkout.php?sid={checkout.order.id}",
   "confirmation": "http://merchant.com/thankyou.php?sid={checkout.order.id}",
   "push": "http://merchant.com/kco/push.php?checkout_uri={checkout.order.id}"
 }
```
You would receive a POST request to the url with placeholder ```{checkout.order.id}``` replaced with correct ```order_id``` and an empty body. E.g. ***http://merchant.com/kco/push.php?checkout_uri=12345***

---

#### 2. Request the Order from Klarna 🎣
Use the ```order_id``` in query parameter ```checkout_uri``` to fetch order from [Order Management API](https://developers.klarna.com/api/#order-management-api-get-order).

```JSON
GET /ordermanagement/v1/orders/order_id
Authorization: Basic pwhcueUff0MmwLShJiBE9JHA==
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### 3. Backup Order Creation 🏬
Confirmation page may fail to load even though purchase is confirmed by Klarna. However, once merchant receives POST request from Klarna at push confirmation endpoint, merchant can be assured that purchase was successful, and merchant should create the order if not done so already.

#### 4. Acknowledge the Order ✅
Next, merchant needs to send a request to Klarna to acknowledge the order. 
``` JSON
POST /ordermanagement/v1/orders/order_id/acknowledge
Authorization: Basic pwhcueUff0MmwLShJiBE9JHA==
Content-Type: application/json
```

?> Klarna will send notification every 2 hours for 48 hours or until the merchant confirms that they have received the order. After 48 hours, Klarna stops sending push notification, but order is still open and can be captured or updated as normal.

##### Order Confirmation and Order Confirmation Push 👊
!> 1. There should be an attempt to acknowledge the order on the confirmation page <br> 2. The order confirmation push should be implemented as a backup <br> 3. If order doesn't exist when push is received, it should be created. If it shouldn't be shipped, order should be cancelled immediately. <br> 4. Every order should be acknowledged or cancelled. Orders that will not be shipped should be cancelled immediately. <br>


### Ship and Capture the Order to Finalize the Payment
At this point, order has been confirmed and merchant can proceed with next steps in order to receive payment from Klarna for theo order. Once product has been shipped, merchant needs to capture the order to finalize payment. Order can be found in Klarna's Merchant Portal or merchant can integrate with [Order Management API](https://developers.klarna.com/api/#order-management-api)
